# Notes

## First Steps

Create a new aurelia app:

```
au new
```

Name it "todo-app" and accept the defaults.

 * Change into the generated app directory: `cd todo-app`
 * Run `au` to see the available commands in this context
 * Use `au run` to start a server with the app on http://localhost:9000
 * Also try:
    * `au run --watch` to start with live reloading
